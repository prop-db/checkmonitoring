/**
 * Self-registration (spec 2026-10-09). PUBLIC: no session is required and
 * none is created. The account it makes is inactive and pending; an admin's
 * APPROVE on /admin/users is the only way it becomes usable.
 *
 * Order: passwords match → length caps → record the attempt and count →
 * throttle → domain. Every submission that reaches the throttle counts,
 * whether the registration is then accepted, refused by the throttle or
 * refused by the domain, so hammering a refused form extends the wait. The
 * attempt is recorded BEFORE the registration runs (which hashes a password
 * and is the slow part), and the count that decides is taken in the same
 * transaction as that insert and under a per-address advisory lock (see
 * `lib/registration-throttle.ts`), so it includes the caller's own row and
 * every earlier same-address commit: parallel submissions from one address
 * queue and count exactly 1..N, with no count-then-insert window to burst
 * through. The caller is refused when that count is greater than the allowance. A mismatched pair and an over-long
 * entry are refused before any database work and are not attempts against
 * anything.
 *
 * A submission that cannot be counted is refused: if recording throws (a lock
 * timeout, a transaction timeout, a database fault) the failure is logged and
 * the person is told to try again; nothing is registered. The lock queue is
 * something a burst can cause on purpose, so an uncounted submission must not
 * pass unthrottled.
 *
 * On success the result carries the address and nothing else; on failure a
 * sentence. A domain error's wording is for the person at the form (the
 * password policy, "already exists"); anything else is logged by name and
 * first message line only and the person gets a fixed sentence.
