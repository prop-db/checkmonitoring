/**
 * THE SCHEDULED SYNC. Vercel calls this twice a day — `crons` in vercel.json,
 * `0 4 * * *` and `0 10 * * *` UTC, 12:00 and 18:00 Manila, and never drifts because the
 * Philippines has no daylight saving.
 *
 * ── SECURITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `middleware.ts` DOES NOT RUN in this project. A route handler has nothing in
 * front of it, so this one authenticates on its first line: Vercel sends
 * `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` when that environment variable exists,
 * and nothing else is allowed to trigger a read of the ERP.
 *
 * An UNSET secret refuses (500) rather than opening. The alternative — "no
 * secret configured, so anyone may run it" — is exactly the default that gets
 * shipped by accident.
 *
 * No session, no user. The run records itself as SCHEDULED.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both tenants, in order, each inside `runScheduledSync`'s own try/catch, so
 * one tenant's trouble never skips the other. 500 if any tenant FAILED, so
 * Vercel's cron log shows the failure; a refusal for want of a watermark or a
 * run already in progress is recorded and is not a failure of the cron.
 *
 * Then THE VOUCHER READ (lib/sync/bills.ts), both tenants in the same order:
 * Acumatica's AP-PAYMENTS-WITH-BILLS, joined on the payment's own reference,
 * appends the AP vouchers each cheque pays to `apvNumbers` — add-only, one
 * audit row per changed cheque, never status. It has its own watermark (BILLS
 * rows on `SyncRun`); with none it records a refusal rather than reading the
 * year, because a first read is `scripts/sync.ts <TENANT> --bills` from a
 * terminal. A BILLS FAILED turns the response 500; a refusal does not. It runs
 * only for a tenant whose payment read RAN this time (SKIPPED_PAYMENT_NOT_RUN
 * otherwise, not a failure).
 *
 * Then THE PO READ (lib/sync/bill-refs.ts), both tenants in the same order:
 * Acumatica's AP-Bills and Adjustments, mirrored into AcumaticaBill (bill →
 * real POs, keyed by APV). Its own watermark (BILL_REFS rows); none → a
 * recorded refusal, because a first read is `scripts/sync.ts <TENANT>
 * --bill-refs` from a terminal. FAILED turns the response 500; a refusal or
 * SKIPPED_PAYMENT_NOT_RUN does not. Neither the BILLS nor the BILL_REFS read
 * is individually time-bounded. A tenant's BILL_REFS read is not begun once
 * 20 s of the run have passed (SKIPPED_TIME_BUDGET, recorded as a finished
 * BILL_REFS row with no watermark; the next run catches up), but one begun
 * before that — or an unusually large incremental BILLS read — can still run
 * long enough to push auto-sign past its 50 s deadline: auto-sign then
 * records FAILED, the response is 500, and the 18:00 run retries what 12:00
 * left. That is the same exposure BILLS already had.
 *
 * Then AUTO-SIGN (lib/sync/auto-sign.ts): on a Manila Tuesday, the Acumatica
 * cheques first read on the Monday become SIGNED; on any other day the run
 * records IDLE. It runs even when a tenant failed, and its own failure also
 * turns the response 500.
