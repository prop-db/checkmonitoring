/**
 * THE SIGN-IN PAGE.
 *
 * Two panels since 2026-09-27: the cash register and the cheque register on the
 * left, still running, and the form on the right. They keep moving for as long
 * as nobody has signed in — the landing page (`/welcome`) shows the same two —
 * and a visitor who already has a session is sent to the dashboard rather than
 * shown a form for a thing they have already done.
 *
 * **Presentation only.** Nothing about authentication changed here and nothing
 * about it should: the `signIn` call, the field names, the generic error and
 * the throttle note below are all load-bearing and are reproduced exactly as
 * they were. In particular the error says the same thing whatever went wrong —
 * see the comment on the throttle note.

          {/* Static, and shown to everybody on every visit — never conditional on
              whether this visitor is actually being throttled.

              A refused sign-in says only "Invalid email or password", whether the
              password was wrong, the account is deactivated, the address is
              unknown, or the login throttle is refusing a correct password. That
              sameness is the point: a message that said "your account is locked"
              would confirm the account exists, which is precisely what
              `authorize` spends an argon2 hash per rejection to avoid revealing.

              But a Finance user who mistypes at eight in the morning and then
              gets refused with the RIGHT password deserves to understand why, so
              the explanation lives here, where it is a fact about the system
              rather than a fact about them. Do not make this appear only after a
              lockout — that would leak exactly what the generic error hides.

              Moved OUTSIDE the card in the 2026-09-10 restyle, and nothing else
              about it changed. It is a standing fact about the system, not part
              of the form, and outside the card is where it reads as one. */}
          <p className="px-2 text-xs leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
            After several failed attempts, sign-in is refused for a few minutes even if the password
            is correct. It clears on its own — wait a moment and try again. Nobody needs to unlock
            anything.
