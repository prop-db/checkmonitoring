/**
 * CASH OUTFLOW BY CHEQUE DATE — what is written and not yet handed over.
 *
 * The cheque-side of the daily cash position Finance asked for on
 * 2026-09-10. The axis is the cheque's own date, read as PRESENTABLE FROM:
 * no pickup or release date has ever been recorded (measured 2026-09-11), and
 * a cheque's date is the day from which it can be presented — which is how
 * Finance's own Cash Balance sheet treats an outstanding cheque. A cheque dated
 * in the past is not a missed forecast; it is exposure, and the buckets say
 * how long it has been exposure.
 *
 * Everything shown is decided in `lib/forecast/` and `lib/forecast-view.ts`;
 * the page reads parameters, runs one query, and renders. The export runs the
 * same query with the same filters, so the file and the screen agree.

        Dates are the check&apos;s own date — the day from which it can be presented. A check on which
        Finance has typed an expected outflow date is placed on that date instead. Planned lines —
        payroll, tax, transfers — sit on their own day. A check dated in
        the past can leave on any day; the buckets say how long it has been presentable. No pickup or
        release dates have been recorded yet; as Finance releases through this system, the RELEASED
        view will begin to show actual outflow by day.
