/**
 * The spec's §13.1 minimum-click workflow: tick several cheques, press one
 * button.
 *
 * **Every cheque is processed independently, in its own transaction.** A batch
 * is a convenience for the user, never a unit of work: one cheque that cannot
 * be signed must not stop the other forty-nine that can, and a single
 * transaction around the lot would roll back real, valid releases because of an
 * unrelated refusal. The price is that a batch can end half-applied — which is
 * why the result carries a line per cheque rather than a verdict for the batch.
 *
 * **The refusal wording is the domain's own.** `lib/domain/` returns sentences
 * written for a Finance user ("required information is missing: AMOUNT"), and
 * they are passed through untouched. A generic "some cheques failed" would tell
 * somebody holding a stack of paper nothing about which one to go and look at.
 *
 * **Nothing here changes a status.** These actions call `lib/domain/actions.ts`
 * once per cheque and it does the work: the guards, the status, the audit row
 * and the portal event, all in one transaction. A second write path would be
 * one that could forget the audit row.
 *
 * **Authorisation failures RETURN, they never redirect.** `requireAdmin`
 * redirects, Next implements a redirect by throwing, and `runEach`'s catch
 * would swallow it and report "Something went wrong" on an action the user is
 * not entitled to. Same pattern as `revertAction` in `./actions.ts`.

 *     set now than were on screen — a colleague marked twenty more ready while
 *     the confirmation sat open — the figures agreed to were never the figures
 *     that would move, so the action refuses and asks for a fresh look. FEWER is
 *     fine: somebody acted on some, and doing the remainder is what was agreed
 *     to.
 *
 * The SET is read from the database, not from the form. The button names a
 * count, not a list, and a form carrying 81 ids is a form somebody can edit.
 *
 * Each cheque goes through the domain call once, through the same `runEach` as
