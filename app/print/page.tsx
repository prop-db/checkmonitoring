 * PRINT RELEASE LIST.
 *
 * ── SECURITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `middleware.ts` DOES NOT RUN in this project — Node-runtime middleware is
 * unsupported in Next 15.5.25 and the file is silently never registered. Every
 * page is protected because it calls `requireUser()` itself, on its first line,
 * and this one is no exception: it lists payees, amounts, banks and cheque
 * numbers.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A page with a `@media print` stylesheet, not a PDF library. The client asked
 * for a print-friendly view of the current selection; a PDF dependency would be
 * a second renderer to keep in step with the table for no gain over what the
 * browser already does well.
 *
 * The selection is carried in the URL and resolved by `resolveDashboardQuery` —
 * the same function the dashboard and the Excel export run, so the sheet holds
 * exactly the cheques that were on screen. A second parser that agreed today
 * would drift the first time a filter was added to one of them.
