/**
 * SUPPLIER RECEIPT — the add-it-later page.
 *
 * The client made the receipt optional at release: "A cheque can be released
 * with the box empty and the receipt added later." This is the later.
 *
 * It is a route of its own rather than a section of the cheque page because the
 * cheque page was being restyled in another branch while this was written, and
 * a feature that has to wait for a file to be free is a feature that ships
 * without the half that makes it usable. The cheque page should link here —
 * that link is the one piece of wiring this change does not include.
 *
 * Guarded by `requireUser()` in the request path, like every other page. There
 * is no middleware protecting anything in this application (see CLAUDE.md), and
 * a page that forgot this guard would be readable by anyone with the URL.
