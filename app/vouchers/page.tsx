              amount is left out everywhere, because there is no figure of

              total, which is a harmless thing for a total to do. HERE it can
              erase the answer to the one question this screen exists to
              answer: measured in `voucher-query.ts`, 17 vouchers are carried
              ONLY by one of the excluded cheques, so they get no row and the
              screen falls silent about them exactly as if no cheque had ever
              been written. That silence is not neutral the way a smaller
              total is — it reads as a fact that is not true. State the
              exclusion, with the count, every time it is nonzero. */}
