          Nothing is written until you have seen the report and confirmed it. Import brings in what
          the workbook knows — amounts, dates, payees, cash accounts. It never changes whether a
          check has been signed, made available, released or cancelled: the register does not know
          those, and neither does Acumatica.

            browser upload: it writes rows one at a time inside a single request
            and a timeout half way through leaves a partial import. Harmless —
            re-running finishes it — but worth saying out loud rather than
            leaving somebody to discover. */}
