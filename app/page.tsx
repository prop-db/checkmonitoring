/**
 * THE DASHBOARD.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER OF THIS PAGE (client brief, 2026-09-06) ─────────────────────
 * "Everything has the same weight, so users don't immediately know what needs
 * to be released today. Since this is an internal finance tool, I'd design it
 * around action first, data second."
 *
 * So the screen is ordered by what it has to answer, and the first three
 * answers are on it before anything is scrolled:
 *
 *   1  KPI ROW          what is ready, what is signed and waiting, what is with
 *                       a signatory, what is in the inventory, what is it all
 *                       worth. Five cards — INCOMPLETE was removed on
 *                       2026-09-06 and ALL CHECKS moved up on 2026-09-29.
 *   2  TODAY'S RELEASE  the action itself, and the only control that hands
 *                       money over.
 *   3  RELEASE TIMELINE where the queue is jammed — 1,034 on SIGNED beside 80
 *                       on READY is the fact no single card states.
 *   4  the secondary row, the quick actions, the filters, the table.
 *
 * RELEASED (9,545) is the largest number in the system and the least
 * actionable. It is the RELEASED step of `WorkflowRow` —
 * still a clickable view, because the cards ARE the view selector and that model
 * has not changed. ALL CHECKS (labelled TOTAL CHECKS until 2026-09-29) is not
 * demoted any more: it is the cheque inventory, and sits in the primary row.
 *
 * ── TWO SCREENS (client, 2026-09-25) ──────────────────────────────────────
 * "Just only show the totals. Once it is click, it will only the list so i
 * can have more space." A bare `/` renders TOTALS — the KPI row, TODAY'S
 * RELEASE, the timeline and a search box. Since 2026-09-29 the TOTALS screen
 * has its own COMPANY / BANK / ELIGIBILITY dropdowns, and those three narrow
 * every figure on it without leaving it. Choosing a card, a timeline node, a
 * search or any other filter writes a parameter that switches the page to
 * LIST — the full-width table with its filter bar, quick actions and export.
 * `dashboardScreen` is the one place that reads the resolved selection and says
 * which screen a URL is; neither screen loads the other's data.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   *
   * The company and cash account ids are checked against the options loaded
   * above — the same list the dropdowns render, so the two cannot disagree
   * about what is selectable.
   *
   * The cards share THREE narrowings with the table — company, bank and
   * eligibility (client request 2026-09-29) — and the exclusion of the cheques
   * with no recorded amount. They do NOT share the view, the search or the
   * incomplete toggle: those open the list. `getSummary` applies the
   * exclusion itself, `buildWhere` applies it for the table, and a PENDING
   * SIGNATURE card whose table opened five rows short is the drift that would
   * otherwise appear the moment the table stopped showing them. The count that
   * is left out is printed on screen with a link that shows it.
