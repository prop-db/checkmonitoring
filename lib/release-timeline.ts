/**
 * The release workflow, as five nodes with live counts.
 *
 * GENERATED → PENDING → SIGNED → READY → RELEASED, each showing how many
 * cheques are sitting on that rung and each linking to that view. It answers a
 * question the cards alone do not: not "how many are ready" but "where is the
 * queue jammed".
 *
 * Pure. No database, no query of its own — every count is read off the summary
 * the page has already fetched, and every link is `cardHref`, so a node cannot
 * disagree with the card that means the same thing.
 *
 * ── WHY GENERATED IS ITS OWN NODE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The PENDING SIGNATURE *card* counts GENERATED + SIGNATURE_PENDING together:
 * to Finance a freshly generated cheque is a cheque waiting to be signed, and
 * that card is unchanged.
 *
 * The timeline cannot fold them, because a node's number has to be the number
 * of rows its link opens, and `viewStatusFilter` gives `?status=SIGNATURE_PENDING`
 * exactly the SIGNATURE_PENDING rows. A node reading 242 over a table of 230 is
 * the same class of defect the READY FOR RELEASE / SCHEDULED fold exists to
 * avoid, pointing the other way.
 *
 * READY does fold SCHEDULED in — there, the card, the view and this node all
 * agree, because `viewStatusFilter` widens `?status=READY_FOR_RELEASE` to both.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * ── ONE CHEQUE'S PROGRESS ALONG THAT SAME LADDER ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The dashboard timeline answers "where is the queue jammed". This answers
 * "where is THIS cheque", on the check detail page, using the same five rungs
 * in the same order — the reader who learned the shape on the dashboard should
 * not have to learn a second one here.
 *
 * Pure, like everything else in this file. No database, no clock, no links: a
 * cheque's own page is already the view, so a rung is not a place to navigate
 * to and none of these carry an href.
 *
 * SCHEDULED folds into READY, exactly as the card, the view and the counted
 * timeline fold it — a portal pickup booking is not a sixth rung, it is the
 * same rung with a date attached.
 *
 * CANCELLED and VOIDED are NOT rungs and are not drawn as one. A cancelled
 * cheque stopped somewhere, and this system does not record where: the status
 * column holds CANCELLED and nothing says which rung it was on when it did.
 * Rather than guess a position, `stopped` is set and every rung reads
 * UPCOMING, so the spine shows an unwalked ladder beside a stated fact instead
 * of a plausible-looking progress bar nobody can substantiate. The audit trail
 * beneath it is where the actual history is.
