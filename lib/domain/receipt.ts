 * The supplier's receipt — the paper handed over when the cheque is collected.

 * `lib/domain/` apart from `actions.ts`.
 *
 * **This is NOT `Check.crNumber`.** That column sits beside `clearingStatus`
 * (NONE/DEPOSITED/ENCASHED/CLEARED) and `clearedDate` and holds the BANK's
 * clearing reference, recorded weeks after release when the cheque comes back
 * through the account. A supplier's Collection Receipt is a piece of paper
 * handed across a counter on the day. The two abbreviate to the same two
 * letters and mean nothing like each other: a receipt number written into the
 * column that tracks whether a cheque cleared the bank would read, to every
 * report and every reconciliation, as evidence the money had cleared. The
 * receipt lives in `orNumber` / `orDate` / `receiptType`, and nothing here ever
 * writes `crNumber`.
 *
 * **The type is stored, not inferred.** "OR-000123" and "4471" and "CR 88" are
 * all references a supplier writes, and parsing the kind back out of the string
 * would be a guess dressed as a fact — the register already taught this project
 * what positional and prefix guesses cost. Finance says which kind it is, once,
 * and the answer is a column.
