/**
 * AUTO-SIGN, THE RULE. User request 2026-10-16, replacing the 2026-10-01
 * "Monday's checks on Tuesday, the rest by SIGN ALL": "Monday - it will be
 * signed on tuesday. The rest of the day, will be signed on Monday." Spec
 * `2026-10-16-auto-sign-monday-and-tuesday-design.md`.
 *
 * Runs on a Manila MONDAY and a Manila TUESDAY. Each run signs every due check
 * first read before 00:00 Manila on the run's own day, with no lower bound: on
 * Monday that is last Tuesday to Sunday and any older backlog (user ruling
 * 2026-10-16); on Tuesday it is Monday's checks and anything Monday's runs did
 * not reach. Wednesday to Sunday sign nothing.
 *
 * "First read" is `createdAt` — when the sync first brought the check in —
 * because Acumatica publishes no creation timestamp and its one date,
 * PaymentDate, is post-dated on some checks.
 *
 * A check a person reverted (`signature_reverted`) is never signed by the
 * clock again: the next run would otherwise quietly undo the revert.
 *
 * The Philippines is UTC+8 with no daylight saving, so a fixed offset is
 * exact. Pure. No database, no clock: the caller passes `now`.
