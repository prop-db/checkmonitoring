 * The statuses at which a cheque has left the release workflow: the money has
 * moved, or it never will.
 *
 * Stated explicitly rather than derived from `TRANSITIONS`, because RELEASED
 * still has an outgoing edge (Acumatica can void a released cheque) and would
 * therefore read as "live" under a terminality test. Nor is it derived from the
 * enum's declaration order — Prisma will happily sort by that, and a future
 * reordering of the enum would silently re-rank every queue built on it.
 *
 * This is what makes the staged queue usable. Measured 2026-09-04: of the
 * register's 2,766 staged rows, 2,467 are RELEASED and 214 CANCELLED, leaving
 * about 28 that are actually live work. A queue that does not separate the two
 * buries the handful somebody has to do under two and a half thousand that
 * nobody does.
