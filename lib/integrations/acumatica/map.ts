 * negative). Both map to the same `(company, checkNumber)`. Measured read-only
 * over 2,000 live rows on 2026-09-04: **67 such pairs among 1,836 keyable
 * cheques (3.6%), and 62 of the 67 carry an IDENTICAL `LastModifiedOn` on both
 * halves**. For those 62 there is nothing to order the two rows by at all —
 * whichever reached `upsertCheck` last won, arbitrarily — and for the other 5
 * the reversal is simply the later row. Either way a cheque could end up
 * storing its own negative reversal as its amount.
 *
 * The ORIGINAL survives, flagged voided. It is the row a human reads off a
 * cheque register, and it is the row the Supplier Portal's own `dedupePayments`
 * deliberately keeps against this same instance.
 *
 * **This is a PAIRING decision, not a sign flip.** Nothing here negates a value
 * or takes a magnitude, and `mapPayment` above still does no sign manipulation
 * of any kind. A reversal that arrives with no original in the batch is passed
 * through exactly as the feed sent it — inventing the cheque's amount from the
 * negation of its reversal would be inventing a fact about money. In practice
 * that cannot happen within a run, because the two rows share a timestamp and
 * so always fall in the same incremental window.
 *
 * Called BEFORE `upsertCheck`, the way `groupByCheckNumber` already collapses
 * the register's ambiguity groups before any row of one is written. Duplicate
 * PREVENTION stays solely the unique key inside `upsertCheck`; this is not a
 * second one, and must not grow into one.
 *
 * Pure, and stable: rows come back in the order the feed gave them.
