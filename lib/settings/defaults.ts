/**
 * THE NINE NUMBERS, AS A LEAF.
 *
 * Each threshold's reasoning lives beside the constant that uses it —
 * `STALE_AFTER_HOURS` in lib/sync/staleness.ts, `MAX_BULK_SELECTION` in
 * lib/bulk.ts, and so on — and each of those constants is now DEFINED from
 * the value here. The registry (lib/settings/registry.ts) reads only this
 * file, so it imports no server module: before this leaf existed it imported
 * lib/sync/run.ts for one number, and run.ts reaches the domain through the
 * importer, which closed a cycle in which the registry could read the number
 * before run.ts had initialised it (found in review, 2026-09-12, twice).
 *
 * This file imports nothing. Change a number here and the constant, the
 * registry's default and the screen's DEFAULT all move together.
