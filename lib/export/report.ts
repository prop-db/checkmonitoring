 * and the per-currency totals row all need the full row set decided before the
 * first byte is written, so streaming would buy nothing here and cost the
 * layout. The production table holds 21,817 rows; 10,000 covers every realistic
 * filtered view a manager asks for with room to spare, and stays well inside
 * the function's memory budget.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-06 on this machine: 10,000 rows build in 2.4 seconds, cost
 * 162 MB of heap and produce a 0.4 MB file — inside Vercel's 1 GB function
 * memory with room for the three queries that feed it. Twice that would not be.
 *

 * truncation into the title block of the sheet itself, so a short file cannot
