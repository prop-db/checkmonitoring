/**
 * Bill detail from the approval-for-release workbook, which is NOT the cheque
 * register.
 *
 * Two things about it govern everything below.
 *
 * **Its grain is one row per bill**, where the register's is one row per cheque.
 * The register puts every APV a cheque settles on that cheque's single row and
 * publishes no per-bill amount; this workbook publishes the amount, due date,
 * terms, GL account and creator of each bill separately. That is why the two
 * feed different tables — `Check.apvNumbers` is a reference list, `CheckBill` is
 * a ledger — and why this parser produces neither a `ParsedRow` nor a
 * `NormalisedRow`. Do not route it through `upsertCheck`: it has no cheque to
 * create, only detail to hang on one that already exists.
 *
 * **It is a current snapshot, not history** — the approval-for-release working
 * list as of the day it was exported. It says nothing whatsoever about cheques
 * outside it, so nothing here deletes or deactivates a cheque or a bill this
 * file does not mention. An absence in this file is not evidence.
 *
 * **Its sheets are not stable and its shape is.** 4 September: `LIST` and
 * `PIVOT`. 7 September: `Sheet3` (the pivot, renamed), `local supplier` and
 * `BROKERAGE`. 10 September: `PIVOT` again, plus the same two data sheets. The
 * parser reads every sheet carrying the 24-column Acumatica header and no
 * others; see `isBillSheet`. It does not know the name `LIST` and must not
 * learn it again.
 *
 * **A voucher can appear on two data sheets.** Measured on the 7 September
 * workbook: `local supplier` and `BROKERAGE` share exactly two vouchers, and
 * both pairs name the SAME cheque — one by an identical cheque number on both
 * rows, one by an unusable `check No.` cell on both, which resolves through the
 * same voucher to the same cheque. So both fold onto one `CheckBill` through
 * the `(checkId, apvNumber)` unique index: the second row updates the first
 * rather than duplicating it, and both rows are recorded in the audit trail
 * with their own sheet. Nothing here needs to arbitrate. If a voucher ever
 * names DIFFERENT cheques on two sheets that is a real conflict rather than a
 * duplicate, and it would have to be staged rather than written twice — it does
 * not occur in any workbook measured so far, and this is not the place to guess
 * at how it should be settled.

/**
 * Which sheets hold bills, as a property of the SHEET rather than of its name.
 *
 * This is the whole lesson of 7 September. The 4 September workbook was `LIST`
 * and `PIVOT`; the 7 September one is `Sheet3`, `local supplier` and
 * `BROKERAGE`, and a parser that skipped everything but `LIST` read zero rows
 * out of it and reported success — the failure this codebase least wants, since
 * a bill that is never read is a supplier never told.
 *
 * What did NOT change is the header. Every data sheet of both workbooks carries
 * the same 24-column Acumatica header on row 1; every pivot sheet carries an
 * empty row 1. So the header is the evidence, and the eleven columns this
 * parser reads must ALL be where they say they are before a single row of the
 * sheet is read positionally.
 *
 * Deliberately strict in both directions:
 *
 *   * a sheet with no header, or a header missing one of these labels, is not
 *     read — it is reported. `Sheet3`'s column 3 holds pivot subtotals, and
 *     reading it positionally would file an AMOUNT as a voucher reference.
 *   * a sheet is not required to be *named* anything. `local supplier` and
 *     `BROKERAGE` are both read, and `sourceSheet` on every parsed row keeps
 *     them apart — the supplier portal exposes broker cheques on a different
 *     endpoint, and that routing is Plan 3's to build on this evidence.

 * Hang parsed bill detail on the cheques that already exist. Writes `CheckBill`
 * rows and nothing else.
 *
 * Never touches `Check`. Not "does not currently" — there is no code path here
 * that could, which is the point: this workbook's `FINANCE REMARKS = AVAILABLE`
 * looks like a status and is not one.
 *
 * Idempotent on `(checkId, apvNumber)`, which is a unique index on the table.
 * Note what that key does NOT say: it does not forbid a cheque carrying several
 * bills. All 85 rows of the 4 September snapshot happen to name distinct
 * cheques, but that is a property of one day's working list, not of the domain —
 * the register carries cheques settling several bills and `CheckBill` is
 * correctly one-to-many. Do not turn this into a unique constraint on `checkId`.
 *
 * That same key is what makes the two vouchers shared by `local supplier` and
 * `BROKERAGE` on 7 September harmless: both rows name the same cheque, so the
 * second updates the first instead of writing a duplicate. Both rows leave
 * their own audit entry, naming their own sheet.
