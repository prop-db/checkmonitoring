/**
 * The OR/CR box, off the wire.
 *
 * Shared by the single release form, the tick-box release and the add-it-later
 * receipt page, and it lives here rather than in `app/checks/actions.ts`
 * because a `'use server'` module may only export async functions — a helper
 * exported from one would become a server action of its own.
 *
 * **An empty toggle is `null`, never OR.** "Nobody chose" is a state the domain
 * has to see, because `checkReceipt` refuses a reference with no type. A
 * default here would answer the question on the user's behalf at the one point
 * where the whole feature depends on it having been asked.
 *
 * **Anything that is not OR or CR is rejected, not coerced.** A server action is
 * an HTTP endpoint and this field arrives from a form nobody has to use; the
 * same treatment `clearingAction` gives a bogus clearing status.
