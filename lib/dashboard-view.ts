/**
 * The dashboard's filtering model, as URL arithmetic.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no DOM, no `window`. Every card on the dashboard is a link
 * to a URL, so what each card does — and which one is lit — is decided here and
 * tested without rendering anything.
 *
 * THE MODEL (client decision, 2026-09-06). The summary cards are not a shortcut
 * to a dropdown; they are the VIEW SELECTOR — which set of cheques you are
 * looking at. The dropdowns on the filter bar then NARROW WITHIN the selected
 * view. There used to be a STATUS dropdown as well as the cards, both writing
 * `?status=`, and a NEEDS ACTION / ALL CHEQUES pair of tabs duplicating TOTAL
 * CHECKS: two controls for one thing, twice over.
 *
 * There are three views and one toggle:
 *
 *   NEEDS ACTION   the default, with no card selected. `LIVE_STATUSES` only.
 *   a status       one rung of the ladder; READY FOR RELEASE folds in SCHEDULED.
 *   ALL CHEQUES    the ALL CHECKS card. Every status, narrowed like any other view.
 *   INCOMPLETE     a toggle that COMPOSES with whichever view is selected.
 *
 * THE INCOMPLETE TOGGLE IS NOW OFF BY DEFAULT AND MEANS "EXCLUDE" (client
 * decision, 2026-09-06): `incomplete: false` hides the 129 cheques with no
 * recorded amount from the counts and the table, `incomplete: true` shows only
 * them. It stopped being a CARD in the same change — the client asked for the
 * card to go — but it is still a toggle in the URL, `?incomplete=1` still opens
 * exactly what it always did, and `incompleteHref` below is the link the
 * dashboard prints above the table so the exclusion is never silent.
 *
 * NEEDS ACTION stays the default deliberately. Production holds 9,287 cheques,
 * 7,433 of them RELEASED; opening on everything buries the cheques somebody has
 * to act on today under eight thousand nobody will touch again, and the row
 * limit means the live ones may not even be on the first page. Removing the
 * scope tabs removed the control, not the default — `describeView` exists so
 * the default is stated on screen rather than silently applied.
 *
 * The URL parameters are unchanged (`status`, `scope=all`, `incomplete=1`), so
 * a bookmark saved before this change still opens the view it named.
