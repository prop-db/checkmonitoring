/**
 * The dashboard's URL parameters, resolved into the one filter object that
 * reaches Prisma.
 *
 * Extracted from `app/page.tsx` when the Excel export arrived. The export is
 * required to hold EXACTLY what the reader is looking at, and the only way to
 * guarantee that is for the page and the route handler to run the same code —
 * a second parser that agreed today would drift the first time a filter is
 * added to one of them. So the page reads its filters from here, and so does
 * `app/api/export/route.ts`.
 *
 * Pure. `options` is passed in — the ids are validated against the rows the
 * dropdowns actually offer, not against the database directly — so every branch
 * below is testable without one.
 *
 * Since part C (2026-10-01) it also resolves the order (URL, then the `cm_sort`
 * cookie passed in `context`, then the default) and the filter row's `f.*`
 * boxes; an unreadable box sets `refused`, which `buildWhere` reads as
 * match-nothing.
