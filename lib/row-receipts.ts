 * THE OR BOX ON A TICKED ROW (client, 2026-09-25: "Once the box was clicked the
 * box for the OR part will be fillable").
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: the table uses it to decide what to draw, and the
 * server's `readRowReceipts` shares the field names. Every box belongs to one
 * row, and that is what makes a receipt typed in a batch safe. The old rule
 * refusing one box for several cheques existed because a single box had no
 * owner; a box per row always has one.
 *
 * Presentation, not a control: `markReleased` and `recordReceipt` re-decide
 * everything on the server (rule 11, no overwrite, released only).
