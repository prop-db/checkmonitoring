 * default. Deleting one row would therefore not fail loudly; it would quietly
 * blank out *who released real money* on every cheque that person ever touched,
 * in the audit trail this system exists to preserve. Removal is deactivation:
 * `authorize` in auth.config.ts refuses an inactive account at sign-in, so a
 * deactivated user cannot do anything, while every attribution stays intact.
 * The export-shape test in `tests/admin/users.test.ts` pins the module's surface
 * so a delete helper cannot be added without deleting a test to make room.
 *
 * These functions take a `PrismaClient` rather than the `Db` union used
 * elsewhere in `lib/`, because each of them opens its own transaction and the
 * last-active-admin guard below is only sound inside one.
