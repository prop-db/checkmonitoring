/**
 * The self-registration throttle (`/signup`, `RegistrationAttempt`).
 *
 * `/signup` is public by definition, and every submission creates a row an
 * admin then has to look at. This bounds how many one client address can
 * create in an hour. It is the login throttle's shape with one bucket: there
 * is no per-email bucket because an email is the thing being created here,
 * not a thing being guessed.
 *
 * **The counter is in Postgres and must stay there.** Same reason as
 * `lib/login-throttle.ts`: Vercel is serverless, a module-scope Map is
 * per-instance and starts at zero on every cold start. `clientIp` from the
 * login throttle supplies the address, with the same rightmost-entry rule and
 * the same shared `unknown` bucket, which is deliberately NOT exempt.
 *
 * **The count is taken after the insert, in the same transaction, under a
 * per-address advisory lock.** A caller records its own submission first and is
 * told how many rows this address now has in the window, its own included, and
 * refuses when `recent` is greater than the limit. Insert-then-count alone is
 * NOT enough: Prisma's interactive transactions run READ COMMITTED, so N
 * parallel submissions each count only the rows already committed and every one
 * of them can see a count within the limit. `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the
 * address, taken as the transaction's first statement, makes same-address
 * submissions queue, so each one's count includes every earlier commit and the
 * counts are exactly 1..N. Different addresses hash to different locks and do
 * not wait for each other; the lock is released at commit or rollback.
 *
 * The allowance is the setting `signup.ipPerHour`; callers read it through
 * `loadSettings` at request time and pass it in. Nothing here reads a
 * constant as the limit.
