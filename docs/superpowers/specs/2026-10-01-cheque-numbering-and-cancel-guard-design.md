# Cheque numbering report, and no CANCELLED event the portal cannot match

**Date:** 2026-10-01
**Request:** two CANCELLED events parked on `/admin/portal` (`6000354350`, `1791259553`) with
*"has no APV numbers; the portal requires at least one"*. Asked why, then: "for the voided checks
can we also import them for recording purposes? Because we are checking the check consecutives."
Then: "yes, do both — the numbering report and the guard".
**Status:** design approved in conversation, 2026-10-01. Gap rule chosen by the user: **every
number counts**. Placement chosen: **a new top tab**.

Two independent parts, built and shipped in this order: **A. the guard**, **B. the report**.
Neither depends on the other.

## Why

- **Voided cheques are already imported.** The payment feed carries `Payment` rows with status
  `Voided` and their `Voided Payment` reversals (`IMPORTED_DOC_TYPES`,
  `lib/integrations/acumatica/map.ts`); the pair is folded into one cheque keeping its original
  amount, and a cheque new to this system is created and then voided in the same transaction
  (`applyVoid`, `lib/import/upsert.ts`). Scope is the sync's: `PaymentDate >= 2026` and
  `PaymentMethod = CHK`. Nothing about ingestion changes here.
- **What Finance cannot do is check the consecutives.** No screen orders cheques by number within
  an account. NEEDS ACTION hides VOIDED; ALL CHECKS mixes every account, and hides a voided cheque
  with no amount behind `?incomplete=1`.
- **The same path parks portal events nobody can deliver.** `voidCheck` and `cancelCheck` queue a
  CANCELLED `PortalEvent` for every portal-routed cheque. The delivery client refuses an event
  with no APV before sending it (`lib/integrations/portal/client.ts`) because the portal matches on
  APV — and every cheque generated since 9 September carries no APV until it is linked. A cheque
  the sync creates already voided is the plainest case: the portal was never told it existed and
  cannot be told it is gone. RETRY rebuilds the body from the cheque and parks it again.

---

## A. The guard

### A1. The rule

`voidCheck` and `cancelCheck` (`lib/domain/actions.ts`) queue a CANCELLED event only when the
cheque is **portal-routed and has at least one APV**. Without an APV:

- no `PortalEvent` is written;
- `portalSyncStatus = NOT_APPLICABLE` (it is `PENDING` today on a routed cheque);
- `portalDomain` is still written from the route, exactly as now, so the eligibility record is
  unchanged;
- the existing `voided` / `cancelled` (and `voided_after_release`) audit row gains
  `portalNotified: false, portalSkipReason: 'no APV numbers'` in `details`. A routed cheque that
  did queue gets `portalNotified: true`. An INTERNAL cheque gets neither key — nothing was
  skipped.

"Has an APV" means what the delivery client means: `apvNumbers` if non-empty, else the cheque's
`CheckBill.apvNumber`s. That fallback moves into one exported helper,
`portalApvs(check: { apvNumbers: string[]; bills: { apvNumber: string }[] }): string[]` in
`lib/integrations/portal/apvs.ts`, used by the client's body builder and by both actions, so the
guard and the delivery check cannot disagree. `load()` in `actions.ts` therefore needs the bills'
`apvNumber` for these two actions.

The other event kinds (MARK_AVAILABLE, RELEASED, REVERT, RELEASE_REVERSED) are **not** guarded
here. A parked MARK_AVAILABLE is a cheque Finance is about to hand over and someone should see it;
a CANCELLED for a cheque the portal cannot match is noise.

**Why not later linking:** spec `2026-10-01-signing-schedule-apv-and-table-design.md` B1 links
vouchers only to **live** cheques (`judgeLink` ignores voided), so a cheque voided with no APV
does not acquire one afterwards; there is no event to send late. A cheque *cancelled* without an
APV is likewise terminal. If it ever matters, the outbox can be fed by a later step; nothing here
prevents it.

### A2. The two already parked

`scripts/close-unmatchable-cancelled.ts` (logic in `lib/admin/unmatchable-cancelled.ts`):

- **Selects** `PortalEvent` rows with `kind = CANCELLED`, `status = PARKED`, whose cheque has no
  APV by `portalApvs`. Nothing else — a parked CANCELLED that does carry an APV parked for some
  other reason and is left for a human.
- **Dry run by default**: prints cheque number, payee, event id, attempts, last error.
- **`--apply`**: writes a JSON snapshot of every selected event and its cheque's
  `portalSyncStatus` to `snapshots/` first; then, per event, in one transaction, conditional on
  the row still being PARKED: `status = SYNCED`, `lastError = 'unmatchable: no APV numbers'` —
  closed unsent, the same convention as `superseded by …` and `stale: …` — the cheque's
  `portalSyncStatus = NOT_APPLICABLE`, and one `portal_event_closed_unmatchable` audit row
  (`details: { eventId, kind, attempts, lastError }`). Idempotent: a second run selects nothing.
- `/admin/portal`'s outbox line (`lib/admin/portal-overview.ts`) counts `unmatchable: …` as its
  own figure, **N closed as unmatchable**, subtracted from delivered the same way superseded and
  stale are.

### A tests

- `actions` (void and cancel): routed with APV → event queued, `PENDING`, `portalNotified: true`;
  routed with no APV and no bills → no event, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `portalNotified: false`; routed
  with no `apvNumbers` but a bill → event queued; INTERNAL → unchanged.
- `import/upsert`: a cheque created already voided with no APV queues nothing.
- `integrations/portal-client`: still uses `portalApvs` (existing cases stay green).
- `admin/unmatchable-cancelled`: selects only PARKED CANCELLED with no APV; apply closes,
  audits, sets the cheque; second run is a no-op; a row no longer PARKED is not touched.
- `admin/portal-overview`: the unmatchable count.

---

## B. The numbering report

### B1. Population

Every `Check` with `isCheque = true` and a `cashAccountId`, **of every status** — VOIDED,
CANCELLED, RELEASED, and cheques with no amount (`isIncomplete`) included, because the number was
used whatever happened to it.

- **The series key is the cash account.** Acumatica publishes no cheque book (`checkBookCode` is
  always null from the sync); the cash account is the one per-account fact every synced cheque
  carries. A register-only cheque with no cash account is not in any series; the page states how
  many there are, as a count with no link (the dashboard has no "no cash account" filter, and
  adding one is out of scope).
- **Numeric only.** `checkNumber` is canonical (`canonicalCheckNumber`), so a bank prefix is
  already gone. A number that is all digits is placed in the sequence, compared as `BigInt` (they
  run to ten digits and beyond; string order would put `999` after `1000`). Anything else is
  listed under **NOT NUMERIC** for that account and is not in the sequence.
- **Company filter**: the existing company dropdown values; narrows which accounts are listed.

### B2. The rule — every number counts

Within one cash account, sort the numeric cheques ascending. Every whole number strictly between
the lowest and the highest held number that no cheque holds is **MISSING**. Consecutive missing
numbers are reported as **one line** — first, last, count — never one row each, because a jump
between booklets can be millions of numbers.

- Two cheques on the same number within one account (possible: `@@unique` is
  `[companyId, checkNumber]`, and a cheque's `companyId` is not constrained to its cash account's
  company) are both shown, flagged **DUPLICATE NUMBER**, and count once as held. Not an error; a
  fact to look at.
- Before the lowest held number and after the highest, nothing is inferred.
- **The scope boundary is printed on the page and in the file**: the sync reads payments from
  2026 onward, so the first number of an account may sit partway through a booklet and earlier
  numbers are not known here. Likewise a cheque Acumatica holds with a memo instead of a number
  is on `/admin/staged`, not here — its number may be one of the MISSING.

Pure function, no database: `buildSeries(cheques: SeriesCheque[]): AccountSeries` in
`lib/numbering/series.ts`, returning ordered entries
`{ kind: 'CHEQUE', cheque } | { kind: 'MISSING', from, to, count }`, plus `notNumeric`,
`duplicates`, and a summary `{ first, last, held, voided, cancelled, missingNumbers, missingRuns,
notNumeric }`. Arithmetic is `BigInt` inside the function; every number and count leaves it as a
decimal string, so nothing downstream does arithmetic on a JS number.

Query: `lib/numbering/query.ts` — one `findMany` per request selecting `id, checkNumber,
checkDate, payeeName, amount, status, cashAccount { id, code, bank.code, company.code }`, ordered
by cash account. ~12,000 rows; loaded whole, grouped in memory.

### B3. Screen — `/numbering`

A new module in `lib/module-nav.ts`, **NUMBERING**, between RECON and ADMINISTRATION,
`adminOnly: false`. Page guarded by `requireUser()` like `/recon`.

- **Summary (no `account`)**: one row per cash account — ACCOUNT, BANK, COMPANY, FIRST, LAST,
  HELD, VOIDED, CANCELLED, **MISSING** (numbers, and runs in brackets), NOT NUMERIC. The account
  links to its detail. Above it the company filter and the count of cheques with no cash account.
  Sorted by account code.
- **One account (`?account=<cashAccountId>`)**: every entry in number order — NUMBER, DATE,
  PAYEE, AMOUNT, STATUS (the existing `StatusPill`), each cheque linked to `/checks/[id]` — with
  each MISSING run as a full-width highlighted line `6000354301 – 6000354349 · MISSING · 49`.
  A **MISSING ONLY** toggle (`?missing=1`) shows just the gaps. A duplicate is flagged
  DUPLICATE NUMBER on its own row; a NOT NUMERIC section follows the table when non-empty. BACK TO ALL ACCOUNTS keeps the company filter.
- An unknown `account` id is a 404 text state on the page, not a widened view.
- Amounts are rendered from the decimal string; no total is shown (the report is about numbers,
  and a total over VOIDED and CANCELLED cheques would be read as money).

### B4. Export — `/api/export/numbering`

Same parameters (`company`, `account`, `missing`), session-guarded like `/api/export/recon`.

- **SUMMARY** sheet: the summary table plus the scope note.
- **One sheet per account** (only the open account when `account` is set; all listed accounts
  otherwise), named by account code (sanitised to Excel's 31-character, no-`[]:*?/\` rule; a
  collision gets a numeric suffix): the entries as on screen, MISSING lines with FROM, TO, COUNT
  in their own columns and the row styled, so a filter on STATUS = MISSING works.
- Cheque numbers written as **text** cells (ten-digit numbers lose nothing, but a leading zero
  would). Amounts as the existing decimal handling in `lib/export/sheet-style.ts` /
  `recon-workbook.ts` does.
- Filename `cheque-numbering-<Manila day>.xlsx`, the `recon` pattern (`slugify`).

### B tests

- `numbering/series` (pure): consecutive run; one gap; a large gap is one line with the right
  count; adjacent gaps around a single cheque; duplicate number; non-numeric excluded; ten-digit
  and mixed-length numbers ordered numerically; single cheque (no gaps); empty account.
- `numbering/query`: includes VOIDED, CANCELLED, incomplete; excludes `isCheque = false` and no
  cash account (counted); company filter.
- `numbering-view` (URL → state): `account`, `missing`, company; unknown account.
- `export/numbering-workbook`: sheets, names sanitised and de-duplicated, MISSING row columns,
  numbers as text.
- `export/numbering-route`: unauthenticated refused; parameters honoured.
- `module-nav` +1.

---

## Out of scope

- Ingesting anything new. Pre-2026 cheques, non-CHK payments and memo-numbered cheques stay as
  they are; the report states the boundary instead.
- Booklet ranges typed by Finance, or a booklet-size heuristic. Rejected in conversation for
  "every number counts"; either can be added later as a narrowing of the MISSING lines.
- Guarding event kinds other than CANCELLED.
- Recording an explanation against a MISSING number (spoiled form, etc.). Worth having once
  Finance has worked the list once and knows what the explanations are.

---

## C. Addendum, 2026-10-02 — dotted re-uses count as used numbers

**Request:** "do the trailing-dot fix" — then, after measurement, the user chose to show dotted
references on NUMBERING rather than change the import.

### Why not strip the dot at import

Measured 2026-10-02 (read-only) over the 773 Acumatica payments staged `NO_CHECK_NUMBER`:
169 state a cheque number followed only by dots (`6000146879.`, `1791361883..`; trailers seen:
`.` 158, `..` 8, `...` 1, `....` 1, `,` 1). Of those, **66 share the undotted number with a
cheque already held here under the same company — under a DIFFERENT Acumatica payment**, often
the adjacent CV (`CV-ST012434 "6000146879."` vs `CV-ST012433 6000146879`, VOIDED). Acumatica
refuses a duplicate cheque reference on a cash account, so a second payment document on the same
physical cheque number is entered with a dot appended (one more dot each further time) — a void
and re-issue, or two vouchers on one cheque. **The dot is Acumatica's "this cheque number again"
marker, not a typo.** Stripping it at import would collapse a second payment onto an existing
cheque under the `(companyId, checkNumber)` key — 66 at least, some onto VOIDED cheques — which is
the silent collision `lib/import/normalise.ts` warns against. The import is unchanged.

### C1. The rule

A staged row counts in a cash account's series when **all** hold:
- `source = ACUMATICA`, `reason = NO_CHECK_NUMBER`, `promotedCheckId` is null;
- its `statedCheckRef`, trimmed, **ends with at least one `.`**, and with only the trailing dots
  removed it passes the existing rule — `canonicalCheckNumber` then `isBareCheckNumber` (so a
  known bank prefix is fine, nothing else is loosened). One pure function,
  `stagedSeriesNumber(statedCheckRef): string | null`, in `lib/numbering/series.ts`;
- its `cashAccountCode` names a cash account here. The series is that account's.

Read only. Nothing is written, promoted or re-keyed; the staged queue is unchanged.

### C2. The series

`buildSeries(cheques, staged = [])` — the second argument is optional, so every existing caller
is unchanged.
- MISSING is computed over the union of cheque numbers and staged numbers, so a number used only
  by a dotted payment is **not** MISSING.
- A new entry kind, `{ kind: 'STAGED'; staged; number }`, sits at its number; at a number a
  cheque also holds, the cheque row comes first, then the STAGED line(s).
- `first` / `last` span both. `held` stays distinct **cheque** numbers. New summary field
  `staged`: the count of STAGED entries. A staged line never sets `duplicate` on a cheque.
- MISSING ONLY shows MISSING lines only, as now.

### C3. Query

`listNumberingAccounts` also reads the qualifying staged rows (≈800 at most), maps each by
`cashAccountCode` to a cash account, honours the same `companyId` / `cashAccountId` filters, and
passes them to `buildSeries`. An account that holds only staged numbers still gets a series.
Staged amounts are two-decimal strings, as cheques are.

### C4. Screen and file

- **Screen:** a STAGED line shows the stated reference verbatim (`6000146879.`), the cheque date,
  payee, amount and a grey **STAGED** label with `Acumatica <CV>` beside it. No link —
  `/admin/staged` is admin-only. The summary table gains a **STAGED** column.
- **File:** a STAGED row: CHECK NUMBER = the stated reference verbatim, STATUS = `STAGED`, NOTE =
  `Acumatica <CV>: the same cheque number used again (staged)`. SUMMARY gains a STAGED column after
  CANCELLED.
- **Scope note** (`NUMBERING_SCOPE_NOTE`): a number Acumatica re-used with a trailing dot now
  counts as used and is listed as STAGED; a memo reference with no number (`PCF26-00001`) can
  still hide behind a MISSING line.

### C5. Tests

`numbering/series` (pure): a staged-only number closes a gap; cheque + staged on one number;
`..` and a bank prefix; a reference without a dot, or not a number once dots are removed, is
ignored; staged extends `last`; `held` / `staged` / `duplicates` counts. `numbering/query`:
qualifying staged rows join their account; a promoted row, a non-dotted row and a WORKBOOK row
are ignored; the company filter applies. `export/numbering-workbook`: a STAGED row and the
SUMMARY column. `numbering-view`: none unless the scope note is pinned.

### C6. Out of scope

Register-staged rows; any change to the staged queue or to import keying; promoting dotted
payments to cheques (the `(companyId, checkNumber)` key cannot hold two payments on one number —
a model change, if it is ever wanted).

---

## D. Addendum, 2026-10-02 — Acumatica's "CashAccount" is the cheque book

**Found** on the live NUMBERING tab right after §C shipped: STAGED 0 on every account, 4 cash
accounts, and "11,614 cheques with no cash account". Measured read-only the same day:

- `CashAccount` holds six register labels (`BPI STK`, `BPI P&P`, `BPI A1`, `MBTC A1+`, `MBTC P&P`,
  `BDO A1`) with 1,342 cheques between them.
- `CheckBook` holds eight codes — `BPI-S-4636` (4,813 cheques), `MBT-A-4155` (2,176), `BPI-S-8879`
  (753), `BPI-A-5713` (573), `MBT-A-9048` (455), `BDO-A-3838` (283), `BPI-A-8879` (14),
  `MBT-S-1121` (5) — all from the retired register.
- **Acumatica's `CashAccount` column states exactly those cheque-book codes** (staged Acumatica rows,
  verbatim: `BPI-S-4636` 256, `MBT-A-4155` 158, `BDO-A-3838` 71, `BPI-A-5713` 32, …, plus
  non-books `PCF-SITIO` 241, `PAYROLL` 3, `PCF-SILANG`, `RSB-S-0869`, `MBTC-S-988`).
- `map.ts` claims the inquiry "publishes no checkbook" and sets `checkBookCode: null`, then looks the
  code up in `CashAccount`, which never matches. Result: **3,844 Acumatica cheques carry no cheque
  book; 3,501 cheques carry neither book nor cash account, 1,091 of them dated since 2026-09-10**.
- NUMBERING (§B) keys on cash account, so it sees ~1,342 cheques; the staged dotted payments (§C)
  carry book codes, so none joins. **The dashboard BANK filter/column and RECON also key on the
  cash-account label** — measured separately and reported as a follow-up, not changed here.

### D1. The sync records the cheque book

`mapPayment` sets `checkBookCode` to the trimmed `CashAccount` value (and keeps `cashAccountCode` as
it is). `upsertCheck` already resolves `checkBookCode` against `CheckBook.code` and writes
`checkBookId` (in `IMPORT_WRITABLE`); a code that is no cheque book (`PAYROLL`, `PCF-SITIO`) finds
none and stays null — nothing is invented. The misleading comment in `map.ts` is corrected. Status
is untouched (rule 4).

### D2. Backfilling existing cheques — a targeted repair, not a full re-sync

A FULL re-sync would rewrite every import-writable field on ~15,000 rows and add an audit row for
each. Instead, `lib/admin/check-books.ts` + `scripts/backfill-check-books.ts <TENANT> [--apply]`:
- reads the payments feed (`PAYMENTS_FEED`, `paymentsInScopeFilter()`, columns `Type`,
  `ReferenceNbr`, `CashAccount`; a voided pair's `Payment` row wins) — read-only by construction;
- selects cheques with `acumaticaTenant = TENANT`, `acumaticaPaymentId` set, `checkBookId` null;
- per cheque: the payment's `CashAccount` → a `CheckBook` by code. **Set only when the book's
  company is the cheque's company**; a mismatch is reported and left (a book under a sibling
  company is the failure `map.ts` warns about). Reported, not set: no such payment in the feed, a
  code that is no cheque book (counted by code), a company mismatch;
- dry run by default; `--apply` writes a JSON snapshot of every candidate first, then per cheque in
  its own transaction (`TX_OPTIONS`, 30 s): `updateMany` conditional on `checkBookId` still null,
  one `check_book_backfilled_from_acumatica` audit row (`{ checkBookCode, acumaticaPaymentId }`).
  Idempotent. Prints counts and codes, never amounts or payees. Run by the user, from a terminal.

### D3. NUMBERING groups by cheque book

- The series key is `Check.checkBookId`; the company filter is the book's company; the `account`
  parameter carries a cheque-book id (the parameter name is kept, so existing links still parse).
- Staged dotted payments (§C) join on `CheckBook.code = StagedCheck.cashAccountCode`.
- Cheques with no cheque book are stated as a count: "NOT IN ANY SERIES: N CHEQUES WITH NO CHEQUE
  BOOK" (page and file). An unknown `account` id is still a not-found state / 404.
- `NumberingAccount` keeps its shape (`accountId`, `account` = the book code, `bank`, `company`).
  `lib/numbering/query.ts` gains `listCheckBookOptions(db)` — `{ id, code, bankCode }[]`, by code —
  which the page and route use instead of `getFilterOptions().cashAccounts`.
- Copy: "cash account" → "cheque book" on the page, the summary header (ACCOUNT → CHEQUE BOOK), the
  file and the scope note.

### D4. Tests

`integrations/acumatica-map`: `checkBookCode` equals the trimmed `CashAccount`. `import/upsert`: an
Acumatica row whose `CashAccount` is a cheque-book code gets `checkBookId`; a non-book code leaves
it null. `admin/check-books` (database; the Acumatica client faked): selection, company mismatch
reported, non-book and not-in-feed reported, dry run writes nothing, apply sets the book and one
audit row, second apply is a no-op, a cheque that gained a book meanwhile is untouched, status
unchanged. `numbering/query` and `export/numbering-route`: regrouped by cheque book.

### D5. Out of scope

The dashboard BANK filter/column and RECON grouping (follow-up, measured and reported). Deriving a
cash-account label from a cheque book. Adding `PCF-SITIO` / `PAYROLL` as books.

---

## E. Addendum, 2026-10-05 — cheque books are shared across companies; the company check goes

**Measured** after the user's first `backfill-check-books.ts GOLIVE --apply` (537 set, 1,070 more
settable, **1,331 refused as company mismatches**), read-only, grouped by (book, book company,
cheque company): `BPI-S-8879` (on record STPP) — 776 STK, 38 A1+, 32 HAMFI, 13 IND refused;
`MBT-A-9048` (A1PP) — 356 A1+; `BPI-A-5713` (A1+) — 70 STK; `BPI-S-4636` (STK) — 21 A1+, 5 HAMFI,
2 IND; and smaller. **The register itself already filed cheques of several companies under one
book**: `BPI-S-4636` holds 4,823 STK + 42 A1+ + 33 HAMFI + 14 IND; `BPI-S-8879` 695 STK + 22 HAMFI +
17 IND + 16 STPP; `BPI-A-5713` 548 STK + 29 A1+; `MBT-A-9048` 396 A1+ + 58 A1PP. **A cheque book is a
bank account, and one account pays several companies' bills.** §D's company check rested on the
opposite assumption. **User ruling 2026-10-05: drop it** — Acumatica's `CashAccount` is the fact.

### E1. Sync and repair

- `upsertCheck` accepts the book `checkBookCode` names, whatever its company. `checkBookRefused`
  goes; `checkBookChanged` stays (a book change on update is still recorded).
- `planCheckBookBackfill` drops `companyMismatch`; every cheque whose payment names a cheque book is
  a candidate. The script stops printing the mismatch section.
- `CheckBook.companyId` stays in the schema and in reference data; nothing reads it for a decision.
  CLAUDE.md "What is missing" item 11 is closed by this ruling.

### E2. NUMBERING

- A series is still one cheque book and still holds **every** cheque in it, of every company — a
  company's view of a shared book must not turn another company's cheques into MISSING numbers.
- The **company filter selects the books that company's cheques use** (a book qualifies when at
  least one of its cheques has that `companyId`), then shows those books whole. The cheque-book
  option list and the `account` parameter are unchanged.
- `NumberingAccount.company` becomes the companies among the series' cheques, most cheques first,
  joined `", "` (e.g. `STK, A1+, HAMFI`); `""` for a staged-only book. The COMPANY column (page and
  SUMMARY sheet) shows that.
- `countChequesWithoutCheckBook` keeps narrowing by the cheque's own company.

### E3. Tests

`import/upsert`: the cross-company cases now expect the book set (create) and moved (update), with
`checkBookChanged`, and no `checkBookRefused` key. `admin/check-books`: the former mismatch cheque is
a candidate and gets its book on apply. `numbering/query`: a book holding two companies' cheques is
one series with `company` listing both; filtering by either company returns that whole book (no
MISSING where the other company's cheques sit); a book with none of the company's cheques is left
out.

---

## F. Addendum, 2026-10-05 — OUT OF PATTERN numbers leave the gap count

**Found** on the live NUMBERING tab right after §E shipped: MISSING read in the billions
(`BPI-S-4636` 600,031,002,200). Measured read-only the same day, per book: each has one dominant
number shape and a few cheques that break it — `BPI-S-4636` 5,974 ten-digit `6000…` plus 18 of
another length (`60000`, `600039037`, `60003162116`, `000006`) and 18 `1791…`; `BPI-A-5713` 610
`6000…` plus 21 off-length and 19 `1791…`; `MBT-A-4155` 2,584 `1791…` plus 10 off-length and 20
`6000…`; `MBT-A-9048` one 11-digit `17913405552`; `BDO-A-3838` 285 six-digit plus 36 written
`0000179xxx` (the same BDO numbers, zero-padded) and a few `1791…`; `BPI-S-8879`, `BPI-A-8879`,
`MBT-S-1121` clean. Almost all misfits are Acumatica rows — a digit dropped or added, or another
bank's number keyed under this account. One of them stretches a series across billions. **User
ruling 2026-10-05: list them separately.** Nothing in the data changes.

### F1. The rule (pure, in `lib/numbering/series.ts`)

- A number's **shape** is `(digits, lead)`: `digits` = its length with leading zeros removed,
  `lead` = its first two digits after leading zeros are removed. `0000179241` → `(6, "17")`, the
  same shape as `179241`; `6000354350` → `(10, "60")`; `1791361374` → `(10, "17")`; `0000` → `(0, "")`.
- A book's **pattern** is the shape held by the most numeric cheques (ties broken by more digits,
  then by `lead`). Staged lines do not vote.
- **Only a series with at least 20 numeric cheques is checked** (`PATTERN_MIN_CHEQUES = 20`). Below
  that there is too little evidence to call any number a misfit, and every number stays in.
- A numeric cheque or staged line whose shape differs from the pattern is **OUT OF PATTERN**: it is
  not placed in the sequence and does not bound any MISSING run. Everything else is as before.
- `AccountSeries` gains `outOfPattern: SeriesEntry[]` (CHEQUE and STAGED entries, in BigInt order)
  and `pattern: { digits: number; lead: string } | null`; `SeriesSummary` gains `outOfPattern:
  number`. `first` / `last` span only the in-pattern numbers.

### F2. Screen and file

- Summary table and SUMMARY sheet: an **OUT OF PATTERN** column after NOT NUMERIC.
- One book: after the table, an **OUT OF PATTERN — NOT IN THE SEQUENCE** section listing those
  cheques (number linked to the cheque page, date, payee, amount, status) and staged lines, with a
  line stating the pattern, e.g. "This book's numbers are 10 digits starting 60; these are not."
  Hidden under MISSING ONLY, as NOT NUMERIC is.
- Workbook: those rows after the sequence, NOTE `OUT OF PATTERN (expected 10 digits starting 60)`.
- Scope note: add "A number that does not match its book's usual length and first digits is listed
  as OUT OF PATTERN — usually a mistyped or misfiled cheque number in Acumatica — and left out of
  the gap count."

### F3. Tests

`numbering/series` (pure): below 20 cheques nothing is out of pattern; 20+ ten-digit `60…` plus one
`60000` and one `1791…` → both out of pattern, MISSING only between the in-pattern numbers;
`0000179241` among six-digit `17…` numbers is in pattern; a staged line of the wrong shape goes out;
`first`/`last` and counts. `export/numbering-workbook`: the rows and the column. Existing tests keep
their meaning (they use fewer than 20 cheques).
