/**
 * The administration tabs.
 *
 * They were four identical white pills with no indication of which one you were
 * looking at — on a four-page area where three of the pages are tables of
 * similar shape, that is a real question a reader had to answer by re-reading
 * the content.
 *
 * A client component only because the current path is a browser fact.
 * `usePathname` is the whole of it: nothing here fetches, guards or decides
 * anything. **The routes are gated in `app/admin/layout.tsx` and again in each
 * page** — `requireAdmin()` on the server, in the request path, exactly as the
 * note in CLAUDE.md about `middleware.ts` requires. Highlighting a tab is not a
 * permission and this file must never grow into one.
 *
 * `startsWith` rather than equality, so a future `/admin/users/<id>` still
 * lights USERS.
