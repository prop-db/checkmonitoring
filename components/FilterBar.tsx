/**
 * The dashboard's filter bar: SEARCH · ELIGIBILITY · INCOMPLETE · RESET. Every
 * other filter is a box in the table's filter row (components/ColumnFilterCell.tsx),
 * joined to this form by `form="list-filters"` — a native submit still sends it.
 *
 * A plain `<form method="get">`, deliberately, and still one. Every control
 * writes a URL parameter, which is what makes a filtered view linkable,
 * bookmarkable and survivable across a refresh — and it keeps working on a
 * Finance workstation whose JavaScript has failed, the same reasoning as the
 * sign-out form.
 *
 * ── AUTO-SUBMIT, WITHOUT LOSING THAT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The client asked for the APPLY button to go: the dropdowns should submit on
 * change and the search box should debounce. That is `FilterAutoSubmit`, an
 * enhancement mounted below.
 *
 * The button is still in the markup. It is hidden by the enhancement on mount,
 * so a reader with a working bundle never sees it, and a reader whose bundle
 * failed still has a way to submit. Deleting it outright would have left the
 * dropdowns inert without JavaScript — the no-JS path is the one property here
 * that is not negotiable, so the button is hidden rather than removed.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The company and bank options reach the filter row from the page, loaded from
 * the database — nothing hardcoded. The eligibilities come from the domain's
 * own list for the same reason — a restatement is how one file ends up with a
 * value another one has never heard of.
 *
 * The page validates every value it reads back, so an unrecognised parameter is
 * ignored rather than passed to Prisma. See `parseStatusParam` and friends.
 *
 * There is NO status dropdown. The summary cards and the release timeline above
 * are the view selector — which set of cheques you are looking at — and
 * everything on this bar narrows WITHIN that view. The dropdown wrote the same
 * `?status=` the cards do, which is two controls for one thing, and the client
 * did not read the cards as filters while a dropdown was competing with them.
