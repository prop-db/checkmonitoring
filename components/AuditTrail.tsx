/**
 * WHO DID WHAT TO THIS CHEQUE, IN ORDER.
 *
 * It was a four-column table, which is the wrong shape for it. Two of the four
 * columns were nearly always an em dash, the remarks — the one part a future
 * reader cannot reconstruct — were squeezed into whatever width was left, and
 * a trail of four entries rendered as a table with a header, which reads as
 * data somebody is expected to compare down the column. Nobody compares audit
 * rows down a column; they read them in order, like a sentence.
 *
 * So it is a list with a rail down the side, oldest first, matching the order
 * the page queries in. The action leads, because it is what happened; the
 * person and the time follow it; the remark, when there is one, gets a full
 * line of its own.
 *
 * ── THE DOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Filled navy for a person, hollow for SYSTEM. That is the one distinction
 * worth a second channel on this list: "Ronald marked this released" and "the
 * Acumatica sync marked this released" are different facts about the same
 * cheque, and the audit trail is where somebody goes to tell them apart. It is
 * never the only signal — the name column says SYSTEM in words.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The year is in the timestamp deliberately. The register goes back to 2024 and
 * a trail reading "Sep 4, 10:45 AM" tells a reader nothing about which
 * September.
